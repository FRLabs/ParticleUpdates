"# ParticleUpdates" 
These updates can be used to update your Particle Device if the Command Line Updater is not working properly.
They must be used in a step-wise fashion starting with the oldest version first.
I used this to update my Particle Electron from 0.4.8 to 0.6.0 which can be a frustrating process if you do not
know the order in which these have to be used.
